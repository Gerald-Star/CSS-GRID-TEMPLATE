    <h2>Defining a Grid</h2>

    <p>
      To define a Grid use display:grid or display:inline-grid on the parent
      element. You can then create a grid using the grid-template-columns and
      grid-template-rows properties. I am using the grid-gap property to create
      a gap between my columns and rows of 10px.
    </p>

    <p>
      This property is a shorthand for grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap so you
      can set these values individually. All direct children of the parent now
      become grid items and the auto-placement algorithm lays them out, one in
      each grid cell. Creating extra rows as needed
    </p>

    <div class="wrapper1">
      <div class="box1">A</div>
      <div class="box1">B</div>
      <div class="box1">C</div>
      <div class="box1">D</div>
      <div class="box1">E</div>
      <div class="box1">F</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Line-based placement spanning tracks</h2>
    <p>
      To create Grid Areas that are larger than a single grid track we specify
      an end line that is more than one track away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I am using the grid-column and grid-row shorthand and have omitted
      the end value for any items that span one row or column track.
    </p>

    <p>
      The grid-template-areas property can be used to define named grid areas
      that can be referenced by grid-area. This is a great way to create a
      layout that is easy to understand and maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also use the Line-based placement spanning tracks with the
      <strong>span keyword</strong> to create the same grid area like this
    </p>

    <div class="wrapper2">
      <div class="box2 a">A</div>
      <div class="box2 b">B</div>
      <div class="box2 c">C</div>
      <div class="box2 d">D</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Line-based placement named lines with spans</h2>
    <p>
      You can give lines the same name and then use the span keyword to target
      lines of a certain name. This is really useful if you want to create a
      complex grid with multiple content tracks and gutters.
    </p>

    <div class="wrapper3">
      <div class="box3 a3">A</div>
      <div class="box3 b3">B</div>
      <div class="box3 c3">C</div>
      <div class="box3 d3">D</div>
      <div class="box3 e3">E</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Using repeat notation</h2>
    <p>
      In example 8 we repeated the same definitions to create our grid with
      named lines. We could save some typing by using repeat notation. The
      values for repeat are the number of times you want the expression to
      repeat and then the expression.
    </p>

    <div class="wrapper4">
      <div class="box4 a4">A</div>
      <div class="box4 b4">B</div>
      <div class="box4 c4">C</div>
      <div class="box4 d4">D</div>
      <div class="box4 e4">E</div>
    </div>

    <!-- Redefining Grid Areas with Media Queries -->

    <h2>Redefining Grid Areas with Media Queries</h2>
    <p>
      can easily redefine the grid and the position of the elements on it using
      Media Queries. I define the Grid Areas as before outside of the Media
      Queries and then redefine the Grid Tracks and the position of the elements
      onto that grid inside my Media Queries.
    </p>

      <div class="box5 sidebar2">Sidebar 2</div>
      <div class="box5 content5">
        Content <br />
        More content than we had before so this column is now quite tall.

    <!-- grid advert -->

    <h2>Grid Advert</h2>

    <p>
      I have some content and then some ads which I have placed right at the
      bottom of the source. I can use Grid to visually display these in between
      sections of content. I could then use Media Queries to display them
      elsewhere in a wider layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Important! For accessibility purposes the logical order should be set in
      the source. Do not use Grid properties to adjust the logical order of your
      document. Read the specification | View example as full page

        <p>
          In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In
          our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
          storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
          granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
          markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they
          are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still
          they are of great service.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section2">
        <p>
          How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice,
          awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is
          their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes this
          keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section3">
        <p>
          A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp,
          resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one
          have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be
          delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting
          and kind regard for them.

    <h2>Nested Grids</h2>

    <p>
      Nested Grid is a good simple example of nesting one grid inside another.
      Any Grid Area can become a grid itself, by setting display:grid and then
      defining the rows and columns.
    </p>

    <div class="wrapper8">

        <p>
          The align-items property is used to align the content inside each
          grid-area.

        <p>Other values of align-items are:</p>
        <ul>
